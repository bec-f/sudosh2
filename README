This is a fork of sudosh2-1.0.2 from the Sourceforge project http://sudosh2.sourceforge.net/.

The main point of the fork is to provide the ability to detect human typing and
stop logging when someone is dumping a large amount of data to the terminal.

Additionally, the application now has the ability to dump directly to syslog
and a utility to replay those logs from the syslog files.
